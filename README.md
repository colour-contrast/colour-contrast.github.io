## Colour Contrast Checker
A simple tool for checking the contrast of a two hex colours.

### Making changes
This tool was created using `create-react-app` and thus `react-scripts`. The following npm/yarn commands are available 

As this is served through gh-pages, the production build is committed to master also. 

All source can be found in the `app` directory.

| Action | Yarn | Npm |
|-|-|-|
| Install Dependencies | `yarn install` | `npm install` |
| Reloading development server | `yarn serve` | `npm run serve` |
| Reloading JEST | `yarn test` | `npm run test` |
| Make production build | `yarn build` | `npm run build` | 
| Format codebase | `yarn format` | `npm run format` |

### Running offline
Serving the root directory from any HTTP server will result in the contrast checker being available in browser.
